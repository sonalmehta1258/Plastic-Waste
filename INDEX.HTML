        <h2>WHAT IS POLLUTION</h2>
        <div class="box2">
            <p>
                Pollution is a term which even kids are aware of these days. It has become so common that almost
                everyone acknowledges the fact that pollution is rising continuously. The term ‘pollution’ means the
                manifestation of any unsolicited foreign substance in something. When we talk about pollution on earth,
                we refer to the contamination that is happening of the natural resources by various pollutants. All this
                is mainly caused by human activities which harm the environment in ways more than one. Therefore, an
                urgent need has arisen to tackle this issue straightaway. That is to say, pollution is damaging our
                earth severely and we need to realize its effects and prevent this damage. In this essay on pollution,
                we will see what are the effects of pollution and how to reduce it.

            <h2>EFFECTS OF POLLUTION</h2>
            <P>
                Pollution affects the quality of life more than one can imagine. It works in mysterious ways, sometimes
                which cannot be seen by the naked eye. However, it is very much present in the environment. For
                instance, you might not be able to see the natural gases present in the air, but they are still there.
                Similarly, the pollutants which are messing up the air and increasing the levels of carbon dioxide is
                very dangerous for humans. Increased level of carbon dioxide will lead to global warming.

                Further, the water is polluted in the name of industrial development, religious practices and more will
                cause a shortage of drinking water. Without water, human life is not possible. Moreover, the way waste
                is dumped on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns toxic. If land pollution keeps on
                happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on. Therefore, serious measures
                must be taken to reduce pollution to the core.

            <h2>PLASTIC POLLUTION</h2>
            <p>
                Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles (e.g. plastic bottles, bags and
                microbeads) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat.[1][2]
                Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris.[3] Plastics
                are inexpensive and durable, making them very adaptable for different uses; as a result, manufacturers
                choose to use plastic over other materials.[4] However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders
                them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade.[5]
                Together, these two factors allow large volumes of plastic to enter the environment as mismanaged waste
                which persists in the ecosystem and travels throughout food webs.[6][7]

                Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. It is estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million tonnes
                of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year.[8] It is estimated that there is a
                stock of 86 million tons of plastic marine debris in the worldwide ocean as of the end of 2013, with an
                assumption that 1.4% of global plastics produced from 1950 to 2013 has entered the ocean and has
                accumulated there.[9] Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the
                oceans by weight.[10] Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical
                effects such as entanglement in plastic objects, problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or
                through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Degraded plastic
                waste can directly affect humans through direct consumption (i.e. in tap water), indirect consumption
                (by eating plants and animals), and disruption of various hormonal mechanisms.[11]

                As of 2019, 368 million tonnes of plastic is produced each year; 51% in Asia, where China is the world's
                largest producer.[12] From the 1950s up to 2018, an estimated 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been
                produced worldwide, of which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% has been incinerated.[13]
                This large amount of plastic waste enters the environment and causes problems throughout the ecosystem;
                for example, studies suggest that the bodies of 90% of seabirds contain plastic debris.[14][15] In some
                areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of free range plastic pollution,
                through reducing plastic consumption, litter cleanup, and promoting plastic recycling.[16][17]

                As of 2020, the global mass of produced plastic exceeds the biomass of all land and marine animals
                combined.[18] A May 2019 amendment to the Basel Convention regulates the exportation/importation of
                plastic waste, largely intended to prevent the shipping of plastic waste from developed countries to
                developing countries. Nearly all countries have joined this agreement.[19][20][21][22] On 2 March 2022
                in Nairobi, 175 countries pledged to create a legally binding agreement by the end of the year 2024 with
                a goal to end plastic pollution.[23]

                The amount of plastic waste produced increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased demand for
                protective equipment and packaging materials.[24] Higher amounts of plastic ended up in the ocean,
                especially plastic from medical waste and masks.[25][26] Several news reports point to a plastic
                industry trying to take advantage of the health concerns and desire for disposable masks and packaging
                to increase production of single use plastic.[27][28][29][30]

            <h2>HOW CAN WE REDUCE OUR PLASTIC WASTE?</h2>
            <p>
                Now onto the most important part – how can we make a difference? Luckily there are several changes you
                can implement as an individual that can have a positive impact. However, it is worth mentioning that
                individual actions are not enough by themselves.

                In our interview with Professor Karl Williams at the University of Central Lancashire, he describes how
                legislation and policy are key to tackling global plastic pollution. This can be anything from laws
                about littering to waste shipment and waste management legislation.

                So keep in mind, throughout these tips, that there are things beyond your control. You can, however, try
                to sway governments and politicians in your direction by emailing them, signing petitions and
                protesting. From there, governments can put pressure on manufacturers and corporations to make changes.

                Without further ado, here are 20 tips on how you can reduce plastic waste in your daily life:
                1. Recycle when possible (and do it properly)

                Recycling, whenever you can, has a positive impact on the planet as it prevents too many plastics from
                ending up in landfills. Of course, recycling systems aren’t perfect, but recycling is still more
                productive than chucking everything in the same bin.

                Different countries have different recycling systems and rules, but here are three rules that generally
                can be followed no matter where you are:

                Recycle clean bottles, cans, paper and cardboard.
                Don’t put food or liquids in your recycling.
                No loose plastic bags or recycled goods should be placed in plastic bags.

                2. Avoid single-use plastics

                Single-use plastic items are one of the biggest offenders when it comes to plastic pollution. You might
                find it harder than you’d think to stay away from them, but noticing how prevalent they are in daily
                life is a good first step.

                Some common examples that contain single-use plastic include plastic-wrapped vegetables in supermarkets,
                wet wipes, cotton buds, plastic cutlery, coffee cups, straws, sanitary products and cigarettes. Luckily,
                there are plenty of alternatives if you look for them.
                3. Use alternative packaging

                If you own a small business, it can really make a difference if you look for alternative packaging
                options. Whether you own a cafe or have a small business on Etsy, you could try more sustainable
                packaging options, including paper and cardboard. If you work in the food industry, you might be
                interested in our Introduction to Sustainable Practices in Food Service course by International Culinary
                Studio.

                Sometimes, we do need packaging that at least emulates plastic in order to protect products,
                particularly when it comes to food. Bioplastics are plastics made from renewable, bio-based materials
                like cellulose, and they have the potential to biodegrade more quickly than normal plastics.
                4. Do a trash audit

                A trash audit is basically where you take a look at your rubbish and track what you’re throwing away
                frequently. Often, we throw things away without a second thought, so this is a great way of
                understanding exactly how much waste we create. A trash audit also allows us to find substitutes for our
                most regularly discarded items.

                For example, if you find a lot of coffee cups in the trash, you know it’s time to buy a reusable cup.
                Alternatively, if you have a lot of crisp packets, consider buying a bigger packet next time and finding
                packaging that’s recyclable. Or, you could look into a scheme like Terracycle that helps you recycle
                crisp packets.
                5. Find reusable options

                We touched on this in our previous points about single-use plastics, but finding reusable alternatives
                is the best way to ensure that you stop using so many single-use plastic items. These don’t have to be
                fancy bamboo alternatives either – even placing regular metal cutlery in your bag, or taking an old
                plastic water bottle with you to work will suffice.

                There are even alternative options to things like clingfilm – learn to make your own zero-waste
                bio-based clingfilm in our open step. To learn more about making sustainable choices, join our Exploring
                Sustainable Living and Loving with Mogli course by Tommy Hilfiger.
                6. Grow your own food

                As we mentioned earlier, lots of vegetables and fruits are covered in plastics at the supermarket. To
                avoid this problem entirely whilst also learning to be more self-sufficient, why not try growing your
                own food? With help from our course How to Grow Healthy Plants by Gardeners World Magazine, you’ll be
                growing your own herbs and veggies in no time.
                7. Buy from local markets and low-waste shops

                If you don’t quite have the time and energy to grow your own food, consider buying food from local
                markets and low-waste shops instead. Depending on the country you live in, buying from markets can be
                either more or less expensive than supermarkets – so it’s a good idea to do some research beforehand and
                find the best option for you.

                Low-waste shops are notably more expensive, but they can be a great option for dried goods such as
                pasta, rice, pulses and nuts. You usually bring your own containers with you and fill them as needed –
                no waste created! You can learn more about tackling food waste in our course, From Waste to Value: How
                to Tackle Food Waste.
